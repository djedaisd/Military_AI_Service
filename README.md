# Military AI Service - Violence Detection & Speech Emotion Recognition

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered system designed for military applications, focusing on detecting violent behavior and analyzing emotions in speech. The system leverages state-of-the-art machine learning models for violence detection in videos and emotion detection in audio, providing real-time insights that can be used in security, surveillance, and situational awareness contexts.


## Features
Violence Detection: Uses advanced machine learning techniques to detect violent behavior in video footage.
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER): Analyzes speech to detect emotions such as anger, fear, sadness, and happiness, providing deeper insights into the emotional state of individuals.
Integration: Both systems are integrated to work together, offering a comprehensive solution for analyzing both visual and auditory data.
Real-time Processing: Both violence and emotion detection can be performed in real-time for immediate response and analysis.
Alert System: Configurable alert system to notify security personnel when violence or concerning emotional states are detected.


## Tech Stack
Backend: Python (FastAPI for API creation)
Machine Learning Models: YOLOv8 for violence detection, pre-trained SER models for emotion analysis
Libraries:
OpenCV for video processing
Librosa and TensorFlow for emotion recognition from speech
Database: PostgreSQL for storing and analyzing historical data (optional)
Cloud Integration: Can be integrated with cloud services for scalability and storage (optional)


## Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/military-ai-service.git

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure you have access to necessary API keys or cloud services if integrating with cloud-based components.

Configure your camera or video source and audio input for real-time detection.


## Usage
Running the Service:


## Start the FastAPI server:

uvicorn main:app --reload
Access the service at http://localhost:8000.
## Using the System:

Upload or stream video and audio for analysis.
The system will detect potential violence in video frames and analyze emotions in accompanying audio.
Alerts are triggered if violent behavior or concerning emotional states are detected.
Integration with Other Systems:

The system can be integrated with existing surveillance systems or security applications via API endpoints.
It can be deployed in real-time environments for security monitoring.
